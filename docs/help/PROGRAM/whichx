      Desc:  Locate a command.
          :  An updated bashist version of the 'which' program.
          :  Functionally fully compatible with 'which', but much more
          :  robust than 'which'.
          : 
          :  whichx returns the pathnames of the files (or links) that would
          :  be executed in the current environment, had its arguments been
          :  given as commands in a strictly POSIX-conformant shell. It does
          :  this by searching the PATH for executable files matching the
          :  names of the arguments. It does not canonicalize path names (for
          :  this, see readlinkx).
          : 
          :  If any 'filename' is not found, returns error.
