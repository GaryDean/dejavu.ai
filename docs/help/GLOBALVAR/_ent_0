          :     # If e.bash has already been loaded,
          :     # then only _ent_0, PRGDIR and PRG globals are initialised.
          :     # If e.bash has not been loaded, then a full load or
          :     # reload of all functions and global variables is done also.
          : 
          :  1. source e.bash new
          :     # ^ load new instance of e.bash;
          :     # do not use any existing instance already loaded.
